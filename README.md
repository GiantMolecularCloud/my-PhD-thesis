# my PhD thesis

###The source code of my PhD thesis. A thesis with book tabs and a flipbook.


Much of the work of my PhD was built on an amazing ALMA data set of the emission of carbonmonoxide in the spiral galaxy NGC253.
Typically, multi-dimensional data sets like this one are visualized as a movie - obviously not possible in a printed thesis.
To still show this special data set in my thesis, I had to implement a flipbook in LaTeX.

My thesis is built on an impressive thesis template: [Classic Thesis by Andr√© Miede](https://bitbucket.org/amiede/classicthesis/wiki/Home).
Aside from a flipbook, I also added book tabs.

In this repository, you can find the complete source code of my [published thesis](https://nicokrieger.de/publications.html).
Feel free to use this as the basis for your own thesis.
